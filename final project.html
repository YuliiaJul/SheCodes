        Have you ever wondered that
        <strong
          >reading can be a wonderful (and healthy) escape from the stress of
          everyday life</strong
        >? Simply by opening a book, you allow yourself to be invited into a
        literary world that distracts you from your daily stressors. Reading can
        even relax your body by lowering your heart rate and easing the tension
        in your muscles. A 2009 study at the University of Sussex found that
        reading can reduce stress by up to 68%. It works better and faster than
        other relaxation methods, such as listening to music or drinking a hot
        cup of tea. This is because your mind is invited into a literary world
        that is free from the stressors that plague your daily life.
